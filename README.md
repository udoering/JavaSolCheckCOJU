# JavaSolCheckCOJU
JUnit free checks of Java solutions provided by students in the context of CodeOcean (with a JUnit adapter)

## Context
Our "Algorithms and Programing" students from various engineering programs need feedback for their solutions of
  - programing exercises and
  - short tests.

The solutions are implemented in Java.
In the first 6 weeks a typical solution of a certain sub task results in a single method.
Later object oriented features (constructors, member variables, sub classes, modifiers etc) are to be impleneted too.

To get feedback the students have to enter their solutions into a [CodeOcean](https://github.com/openHPI/codeocean) instance, which is hosted at TU Ilmenau.
